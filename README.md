# simple_Ecommerce
### Project Goals
The goal for this project is to simply understand the functioning of the Django framework coming from a background in Flask.
### Flask vs Django
Overall the 2 frameworks are quite similar but Flask is a lot more straight-forward to get use to. Though, Django offers more built-in default modules like Django Admin module and more. Although with a steeper understanding curve, Django seems more powerful and ultimately faster with developing structured web applications where database logic is needed.
### Project Description
The application is a simple eCommerce as you can tell by the name. As of now, there is a simple store application that contains a list of the products listed for sale. The store front-end is linked to a sqlite database of products.
### Further Work and Scaling
Instead of a simple html page rendered we can return a whole react application built with front-end components so that the website front-end is more scalable and structured. Also in the deploying phase we can arrange the system in separated kubernetes nodes for distribution principles. The database can also be improved, and buy and shopping cart features are missing.
